            Programming refers to a technological process for telling a computer
            which tasks to perform in order to solve problems. You can think of programming as
            a collaboration between humans and computers, in which humans create instructions for
            a computer to follow (code) in a language computers can understand. 
            At its most basic, programming tells a computer what to do. First, a programmer writes
            codeâ€”a set of letters, numbers, and other characters. Next, a compiler converts each 
            line of code into a language a computer can understand. Then, the computer scans the 
            code and executes it, thereby performing a task or series of tasks. Tasks might include
            displaying an image on a webpage or changing the font of a section of text.
